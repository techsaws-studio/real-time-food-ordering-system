# Real Time Food Ordering System

A full-stack restaurant management web app built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO.

This system enables customers to scan a table QR code, browse the menu, place orders, and track them live, while the kitchen dashboard updates in real time and the admin panel manages menus, tables, and payments.
